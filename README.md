## Getting Started

1. Open `FingerCursor.xcodeproj` in Xcode 15 or newer.
2. Select the `FingerCursor` scheme and build/run on "My Mac".

## Gestures:

1. Move your cursor by holding up your index finger (of either hand) and moving it around. 
2. To left click, raise your pinky finger to make a 🤘 pose.
3. To right click, keep your index finger up and raise your middle finger to touch your index finger.
4. To scroll, bring your other hand in the frame and gently drag it up or down.
5. To type, open your palm to make a ✋ pose, and start talking. It will automatically transcribe your voice!
